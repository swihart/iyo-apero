I am maintaining Jim Lindsey's `event` on CRAN which contains functions for setting up and analyzing event history data.  Note, this CRAN version has `survkit` removed. A newer version of `survkit`, with accessibility to R, is available independent of `event`. More info at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693034/> and <http://www.nas.boku.ac.at/nuwi/the-survival-kit/>.
