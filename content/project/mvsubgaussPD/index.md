Here's a simple mnemonic for remembering the package name:

  *  `PD` stands for *Product Distribution*
  *  `mv` stands for *multivariate*
  *  `subgauss` stands for *elliptically contoured stable distribution -- which has the subgaussian property*
  
Who's the ad wizard that came up with that one? :smile:

Provides [dpr] functionality in addition to fitting distributions (i.e., estimating parameters from data -- based on the Nolan (2013) approach).
