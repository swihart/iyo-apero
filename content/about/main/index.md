intro: |
  Iâ€™m a mathematical statistician at  NIAID of the National Institutes of Health. Primarily, my scientific collaborations at NIH are in studying malaria and span the entire development process for transmission blocking vaccines -- from bench-work assays to human vaccine trials in Africa.  My statistical methodological research interests include correlated binary outcomes, for which I am a bridge distribution enthusiast. I'm a strong proponent of getting the numbers out of the computer to make theory come to life and I best do that by developing and maintaining R-packages, as seen in [Projects](/project). I enjoy that my education continues daily, and I am thankful for the foundation from my educators and educational degrees:

  * <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap pr2"></i>PhD &#8729; Biostatistics &#8729; 2011 &#8729; *Johns Hopkins BSPH*
  * <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap pr2"></i>MS&nbsp; &#8729; Biostatistics &#8729; 2006 &#8729; *Univ. of Colorado SPH*
  * <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap pr2"></i>BS&nbsp; &#8729; Applied Mathematics &#8729; 2004 &#8729; *Univ. of Colorado*

  And lastly -- a friendly reminder that all opinions on this page are my own and not representative of any institution, employers, or collaborators.
