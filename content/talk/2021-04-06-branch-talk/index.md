Each of us in the Biostatistics Research Branch at NIAID give Branch Talks (usually research in progress) meetings during the year.  Here's the slide deck from my talk in 2021. Since the talk is in-house, I had some fun with it and jammed in some memes. I focused on a paper I wrote with Dipankar Bandyopadhyay that uses the Weibull distribution with Positive Stable frailty to enable bridging.  In addition to detailing how the four parameterizations were related, we found a closed form solution to the integrated likelihood which led to vast computation time improvements.
